# Income
Copy of my Data Science project from Junior year at St. Olaf.

Feel free to browse the code to see the process.

All .csv files were scraped from websites and converted through different processes.

This was to make working with thee data consistent.

To see the results, either open plotting.Rmd in Rstudio and run, OR open plotting.html in your browser.

The goal of this project was to demonstrate the divergent growth rate of average house income and CPI in general, as well as housing prices (spoiler: things got way more expensive at a rate vastly higher than the average income grew).
